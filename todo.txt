Status:
? = Not sure if worth the effort or useful at all.
- = Planned.
X = In progress, some work done.
* = Done.

After 1.0.0:
* Improved makefiles with settings section and shared common part.
* Queues macros should not refer to the semaphore counters directly.
* Priority ordering option for semaphores.
* chSysLock() and chSysUnlock() with counter (option).
* OSEK-style chSysSuspendAll()/chSysResumeAll()/chSysEnable()/chSysDisable(),
  implemented this as the new Suspended and Disabled states in 1.1.
* Mailboxes subsystem (lwIP requires them).
* Multiple debug switches.
  * Split asserts from parameters checks.
  * Add checks to all APIs.
  * Stack checks option.
  * Threads profiling option.
* Idle loop hook macro.
* Switch the configuration options to TRUE/FALSE rather than def/undef.
X Remove port_puts() from all the ports.

After 1.2.0:
- Threads Pools manager in the library.
  - New chThdCreate() that takes just two parameters, a pointer to a thread
    descriptor and the tread parameter. It could wrap the current variants
    or just be an alternative.
- Minimal optional C-runtime library (complete enough for lwIP).
- OSEK-style simple tasks within the idle thread.
? Think to something for threads restart.
? Multiple heaps, disjoint heaps, heaps in heaps.
- Abstract I/O channels rather than just serial ports.
  - Move the serial drivers implementations in library al keep the I/O channel
    interface as part of the kernel. Better keep the core as compact as
    possible.
- Update C++ wrapper (Heap, Pools, Mailboxes and any new feature).

Ideas for 2.x.x:
- Reference counter for threads, concept of detached threads, threads
  management.
- Think to the high resolution timers and tickless kernel.
- Multicore support.

Side projects:
X lwIP TCP/IP stack integration and demo.
X FatFS library integration and demo.
X ChibiOS Wizard, UML modeling and ChibiOS applications code and
  documentation generator.
X OSEK layer.
- Posix layer.
X File System
- Visual debugger/monitor interfaced through OpenOCD.
  - Objects registry in the kernel.

Lower priority:
- More demos
- More ARM ports
? PIC24 port
- Microblaze port
- PowerPC port
? Coldfire port
? H8 port
