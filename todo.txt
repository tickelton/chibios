After 1.0.0:
- Update C++ wrapper (Heap, Pools).
* Priority ordering option for semaphores.
* chSysLock() and chSysUnlock() with counter (option).
X OSEK-style chSysSuspendAll()/chSysResumeAll()/chSysEnable()/chSysDisable().
- OSEK-style simple tasks within the idle thread.
- Think to something for threads restart.
- lwIP TCP/IP stack integration.
- Minimal optional C-runtime library (complete enough for lwIP).
- Multiple heaps, disjoint heaps, heaps in heaps.
- Multiple debug levels.
- Stack guard pages.
* Idle loop hook macro.
X Switch the configuration options to TRUE/FALSE rather than def/undef.

Ideas for 2.x.x:
- Reference counter for threads, concept of detached threads, threads
  management.
- Think to the high resolution timers and tickless kernel.
- Multicore support.

Side projects:
X ChibiOS Wizard, UML modeling and Chibi applications code and
  documentation generator.
X OSEK layer.
- Posix layer.
X File System

Lower priority:
- More demos
- More ARM ports
- PIC24 port
- Microblaze port
- PowerPC port
- Coldfire port
- H8 port

- - Planned.
X - In progress
* - Done
