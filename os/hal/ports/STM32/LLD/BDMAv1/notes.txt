STM32 BDMAv1 driver.

Driver capability:

- The driver supports the "basic" DMA controller.

The file registry must export:

STM32_DMAn_CHx_HANDLER      - Vector name for IRQ "x" (1..7). If the macro
                              is not exported then the ISR is not declared.
STM32_DMAn_CHx_NUMBER       - Vector number for IRQ "x" (1..7).
STM32_DMA_CACHE_HANDLING    - TRUE if the device requires explicit cache
                              handling on DMA buffers.
